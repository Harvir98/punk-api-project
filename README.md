# Punk-API Project

Introduction to React and API's.

## Description

During my fifth week of the nology training programme, I was tasked to create a webpage using React, as well as implementing external API's using Fetch.

The webpage displays a list of Brewdog beers styled as cards. The information for the beers came from the Punk API, which is openly available.

The beers can be filtered as seen in the navbar. The filters are as follows: 

1. Searchbar by name
2. ABV
3. Classic Range (brewed before a certain date)
4. pH

## Files

App.JSX is where the main logic is carried out.

There is also a components and containers folder. The file tree is as follows, App.jsx -> Containers -> Components.

Within each of the folders, there is also a folder for each component and containers. E.g, FilterList folder with a corresponding jsx and scss file.

## Challenges Faced

This was the first time using React and having only learnt it for a week, initially I struggled. Especially with understanding how the components, containers and app.jsx related to each other.

Introduction to React and API's

## Description

During my fifth week of the nology training programme, I was tasked to create a webpage using React, as well as implementing external API's using Fetch.



## Files

App.JSX is where the main logic is carried out.

There is also a components and containers folder. The file tree is as follows, App.jsx -> Containers -> Components.

Within each of the folders, there is also a folder for each component and containers. E.g, FilerList folder with a corresponding jsx and scss file.

## Challenges Faced

This was the first time using React and having only learnt it for a week, initially I struggled. Especially with understanding how the components, containers and app.jsx related to each other..
